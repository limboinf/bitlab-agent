# Feature matrix

This document records Bitlab's intentional product boundary relative to the upstream baseline. A side-by-side technical comparison with Craft Agents, including installer sizes, lives in [`comparison-with-craft.md`](./comparison-with-craft.md).

## Retained

- Electron Desktop, WebUI, headless server, shared renderer, and WebSocket RPC
- Pi agent backend, API-key model connections, and ChatGPT Plus / Claude Pro/Max subscriptions
- Custom OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible endpoints, plus Ollama
- Local multi-workspace support and the `default` workspace
- Sessions (create, continue, cancel, resume, search, rename, delete, flag, archive, unread, import/export, branch, multi-window)
- Skills, mini chat, plans, annotations, follow-ups
- Browser pane + `web_search` + `web_fetch`
- Attachments and document tools
- Permissions (safe / allow-all), network proxy, themes, English and Simplified Chinese
- Auto-update integration

## Removed

- Claude Agent SDK backend
- GitHub Copilot and all OAuth beyond the two retained LLM subscriptions
- External messaging channels and workers
- Product automations and schedulers
- Session labels and user-defined statuses
- Projects and Kanban
- Sources (API Source, MCP Source) and MCP servers
- Viewer app, public sharing, and remote workspaces
- Image generation (`gen_image`)

## Reference policy

Retained modules follow the upstream directory layout, public names, coding style, and tests. The product name is Bitlab. Runtime identifiers still use the existing lineage (`@bitlab/*`, `~/.bitlab`, `BITLAB_*`, `bitlab://`, `app.bitlab.desktop`). Reference repositories are read-only.

## Numerical anchors

| Metric | Bitlab | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Tracked source TS/TSX LOC | 190,558 | excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, `release`, `.git` |
| Source files audited against Craft | 1,163 | see [`comparison-with-craft.md`](./comparison-with-craft.md#1-repository--source-line-count) |
| Same-path rate | 96 % | byte-equal after normalization for 59 % |
| Top-level `dependencies` | 55 | drops 6 backend/OAuth/MCP/Copilot packages |
| License | Apache-2.0 | notice in `NOTICE` |

## Verifying the boundary

The automated source-lineage audit was removed during the Bitlab rename. The
figures above are a point-in-time snapshot against the pinned Craft baseline; to
re-check the boundary, diff against the baseline commit by hand as described in
[`upstream-sync.md`](./upstream-sync.md).
